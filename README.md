* ## Image Captioning Problem

### model based on [Image Captioning with Keras](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-captioning-with-keras-teaching-computers-to-describe-pictures-c88a46a311b8)
### Missing data from the challenge was acquiered from [Common Objects in Context website](https://cocodataset.org/#download)

### I recommend using the anaconda distro, that way you simply can take the [env file](env.yml) and [requirements file](requirements.txt) to replicate the conditions with which I implemented this project.

### First, go through the [Data Exploration](data_exploration.ipynb), where data collection, data exploration and data trasformations happen. As you might imagine [or already know], getting to know your data and making it strategically useful are fundamental steps for any Machine Learning project.
